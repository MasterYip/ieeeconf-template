Therefore, \revise{3.1}{simple gradient ascent search for actor updates can be performed.}
In DDPG, the policy to be learned is deterministic, and it might not try
enough to explore the environment. To increase exploration ability,
zero-mean random noise can be added to deterministic actions and initial
states can be sampled from a given state distribution at the beginning
of environment interaction. The noise is added to the action before it
is executed in the environment. The noise is generated by a Gaussian process,
which is a stochastic process that can be used to model the uncertainty in the environment.
The Gaussian process is defined by its mean and covariance functions,
which determine the shape of the noise distribution. The mean function is typically set to zero,
and the covariance function is chosen to
be a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, which allows for smooth variations in the noise.
